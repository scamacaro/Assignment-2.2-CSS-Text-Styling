Assignment 2.2: CSS Text Styling

Guidelines and Expectations
Experiment with the different properties that affect text display, and various text formats to create effective and interesting page design. You can use for reference the constitution.html and style.css posted, which is just a plain black and white text version using some very basic CSS.

Be creative and come up with the formatting (text, background, spacing) to make this jump out and catch a viewer's attention.

To receive full credit, you may NOT submit the sample CSS file for this assignment. It is provided as an example. You should create your own CSS file and add a few styles that you understand to it.

Once you are happy with how the text on the webpage looks, upload the files to the validators, and take screenshots:

HTML validator https://validator.w3.org/Links to an external site.
CSS validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Links to an external site.
Then

Create a new Readme.txt file with notepad.
This is different than your HTML and CSS files. This is considered documentation about your website, this is not your actual website or web pages.
Include a description of what the page(s) output in a readme.txt. This is as simple as "copy and paste" the assignment requirements.
Include the HTML and CSS page name(s) in your readme.txt file.
Use good formatted, easy-to-read, and commented CSS code.
Watch this video for how to use GitHub.

Deliverables:
Upload the HTML, CSS and Readme.txt files to your public repo on GitHub. 
View the page using the GitHub HTML previewer: https://htmlpreview.github.io/Links to an external site.
Include Screen prints of your webpage from the GitHub HTML previewer, along with the HTML and CSS validations.
To receive full points, follow the rubric and submit your answers in the submission area by the due date.
